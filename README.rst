- The surfaces of different families are identified and the surface energy associated with the surface are specified.

- gamma-plot is obtained by fine tuning of the parameters alpha and w to ensure no overlapping between the energy minima

- similarly xi vector is obtained by differentiating :math:'\hat{\gamma}=P\gamma(\vec{n})' in P space where :math:'P=r\gamma'

.. math::
   
   \vec{\xi}=\nabla_{P}\hat{\gamma}
